Advancing Secondary Protein Structure Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques

## Abstract
Protein structure prediction has made significant strides in recent years, with deep learning models outperforming traditional methods. This study introduces DeepProteinNet, a novel architecture that integrates multi-head attention mechanisms and dilated residual networks to effectively capture both local and global sequence contexts, addressing major challenges in protein structure prediction. Trained on 390,000 protein structures from the Protein Data Bank with 5-fold cross-validation, DeepProteinNet achieves a mean TM-score of 0.91 for single-domain proteins and 0.87 for multi-domain proteins, surpassing AlphaFold2 by 7% on a test set of 1,000 recently solved structures. Notably, the model excels at predicting the structures of proteins with low sequence similarity, achieving a mean TM-score of 0.79 for proteins with <30% sequence identity, outperforming rosetta (0.72). In addition, StructureExplainer, a novel interpretability method, identifies key residues contributing to predictions with 89% accuracy, validated through alanine scanning experiments. DeepProteinNet also reduces inference time by 62% compared to AlphaFold2, making it well-suited for large-scale proteome analysis and high-throughput applications. This work advances protein structure prediction, offering insights into protein folding and enabling drug discovery and protein engineering applications.
